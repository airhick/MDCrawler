# Railway Deployment Guide - Crawler v2.1.1

## üöÇ Problem & Solution

### Issue
When deployed to Railway, the crawler returns empty content for JavaScript sites because **Playwright browsers are not installed** in the container.

**Symptom**: 
```
# Eratos
URL: https://www.eratos.ch/

(empty - only 7 lines)
```

**Expected**:
```
Full content - 8,915 characters with 5 pages
```

### Solution
Updated Dockerfile to install Chromium browser and all required dependencies.

---

## üì¶ Updated Dockerfile

### Changes Made

1. **Added Playwright browser path**
   ```dockerfile
   ENV PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/ms-playwright
   ```

2. **Installed Chromium system dependencies**
   ```dockerfile
   # 18 additional packages for browser support
   libnss3, libnspr4, libatk1.0-0, libatk-bridge2.0-0,
   libcups2, libdrm2, libdbus-1-3, libxkbcommon0,
   libxcomposite1, libxdamage1, libxfixes3, libxrandr2,
   libgbm1, libpango-1.0-0, libcairo2, libasound2,
   libatspi2.0-0, libxshmfence1
   ```

3. **Install Playwright browsers**
   ```dockerfile
   RUN python -m playwright install chromium --with-deps
   ```

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit Changes

```bash
cd /Users/Eric.AELLEN/Documents/A\ -\ projets\ pro/crawler/1.1

git add Dockerfile requirements.txt app.py
git commit -m "feat: Add Playwright support for JS rendering in production"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Railway will automatically rebuild

Railway detects the Dockerfile and rebuilds with:
- ‚úÖ Playwright installed
- ‚úÖ Chromium browser installed
- ‚úÖ All system dependencies

**Build time**: ~3-5 minutes (Chromium download is ~200MB)

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

Test the webhook:
```bash
curl "https://n8n.goreview.fr/webhook/2309b53e-735f-4103-9988-dabb68366dab?url=https://www.eratos.ch/"
```

Should now return **8,915+ characters** instead of 7 lines.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Build fails

**Error**: "Failed to install Playwright browsers"

**Solution**: Railway might need more memory. In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to Settings
2. Increase memory limit to at least 2GB
3. Retry deployment

### Issue: Timeout errors

**Error**: "Playwright timeout 30000ms exceeded"

**Solution**: Increase timeout in requests:
```json
{
  "url": "https://www.eratos.ch",
  "timeout": 30.0
}
```

### Issue: Out of memory

**Error**: "Container killed (OOM)"

**Solution**: 
1. Reduce `max_pages` (use 3-5 instead of 10)
2. Increase Railway plan memory
3. Add rate limiting: `"rate_limit_delay": 2.0`

## üìä Resource Usage

### Docker Image Size

| Component | Size |
|-----------|------|
| Base Python 3.11-slim | ~150MB |
| System dependencies | ~100MB |
| Python packages | ~100MB |
| Chromium browser | ~200MB |
| **Total** | **~550MB** |

### Runtime Resources

| Metric | Static Sites | JS Sites |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Memory | ~100MB | ~300MB |
| CPU | Low | Medium |
| Time per page | 50-200ms | 2-5s |

### Railway Costs

**Starter Plan** (Free):
- 500 hours/month
- 512MB RAM (might be tight)
- Sufficient for testing

**Developer Plan** ($5/month):
- Unlimited hours
- 2GB RAM (recommended)
- Better for production

---

## üéØ Configuration for Production

### Environment Variables (Optional)

Add in Railway dashboard:

```bash
# Increase timeouts for slow sites
CRAWL_TIMEOUT=30

# Limit pages to save resources
MAX_PAGES_DEFAULT=5

# Enable debug logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Optimal Settings for Railway

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "depth": 1,
  "max_pages": 5,          // Lower = less memory
  "timeout": 25.0,         // Higher for JS sites
  "rate_limit_delay": 1.0, // Prevent rate limiting
  "use_js_rendering": true
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist

After deployment, test these scenarios:

### 1. Static Site (Fast)
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/crawl \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com", "depth": 0, "max_pages": 1}'
```
**Expected**: ~200ms, clean content ‚úÖ

### 2. JavaScript Site (Playwright)
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/crawl \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.eratos.ch", "depth": 1, "max_pages": 3}'
```
**Expected**: ~10-15s, full content ‚úÖ

### 3. Multi-Language Site (Anti-redundancy)
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/crawl \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.planzer.ch", "depth": 1, "max_pages": 3}'
```
**Expected**: Clean output, no menu repetition ‚úÖ

## üö® Important Notes

### 1. First Request Might Be Slow
- Chromium needs to start (~2-3s overhead)
- Subsequent requests are faster
- Consider implementing browser context reuse in v2.2

### 2. Memory Management
- Each browser instance uses ~150MB
- Close browsers after each crawl (already implemented)
- Monitor Railway metrics

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Add delays between requests
- Respect robots.txt
- Use `rate_limit_delay: 1.0` minimum

### 4. Cold Starts
- Railway sleeps inactive services
- First request after sleep: ~10-15s
- Subsequent requests: normal speed

---

## üìà Performance Optimization

### For Faster Builds

1. **Use Docker layer caching**
   ```dockerfile
   # Already implemented - deps installed before code copy
   COPY requirements.txt ./
   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
   COPY app.py ./
   ```

2. **Pin exact versions**
   ```txt
   # requirements.txt already pinned
   playwright==1.49.0
   ```

### For Lower Memory Usage

If Railway memory is an issue:

1. **Disable JS rendering by default**
   ```python
   use_js_rendering: bool = False  # Opt-in instead of default
   ```

2. **Reduce max pages**
   ```python
   max_pages: int = 3  # Instead of 10
   ```

3. **Add memory limit to Playwright**
   ```python
   browser = await p.chromium.launch(
       headless=True,
       args=['--disable-dev-shm-usage', '--no-sandbox']
   )
   ```

## üîÑ Alternative Deployment Options

### Option 1: Render.com (Alternative to Railway)

Similar setup, but might have better free tier for memory:

```yaml
# render.yaml already exists
services:
  - type: web
    env: docker
    dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile
```

### Option 2: Separate JS Rendering Service

For high-volume use, consider:
1. Main crawler on Railway (static sites)
2. Separate Playwright service on dedicated server
3. API call between them

### Option 3: Serverless with Puppeteer

For sporadic use:
- AWS Lambda with Puppeteer layer
- Vercel with @sparticuz/chromium
- Trade-off: Cold starts but cheaper
