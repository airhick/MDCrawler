# JavaScript Rendering Support - v2.1

## 🎭 Problem Solved

Many modern websites are **Single Page Applications (SPAs)** built with React, Vue, Angular, Next.js, etc. These sites:
- Return minimal HTML (just a shell with `<div id="root"></div>`)
- Load all content via JavaScript after page load
- Have 0 links in the initial HTML
- Are invisible to traditional crawlers

### Example: eratos.ch

**Before (httpx only)**:
```
Status: 200
Content length: 2640 chars
Total links found: 0
Main content length: 0 chars
```

**After (with Playwright)**:
```
✅ Crawled 5 pages
✅ 2,101+ chars of content per page  
✅ Total output: 8,915 characters
✅ Links extracted and followed
```

---

## ✨ Solution: Hybrid Crawling

The crawler now uses a **smart hybrid approach**:

### 1. Fast Path (Static HTML)
- Try `httpx` first (milliseconds, no browser overhead)
- Works for 80% of sites (traditional server-rendered sites)

### 2. JS Detection
- Analyzes the HTML for SPA indicators:
  - `id="root"`, `id="app"`, `id="__next"`
  - `data-reactroot`, `data-vite-theme`
  - `ng-app`, `v-app` (Angular, Vue)
- Checks body content length (< 100 chars = likely JS-rendered)

### 3. Smart Fallback (Playwright)
- If JS-rendered detected → Use headless Chromium
- Wait for DOM content to load
- Wait for body to have content (dynamic wait)
- Scroll to trigger lazy loading
- Extract fully rendered HTML

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Components

1. **`PLAYWRIGHT_AVAILABLE`** - Feature flag (graceful degradation if not installed)

2. **`is_js_rendered_site(html)`** - Detector function
   - Checks for SPA framework indicators
   - Measures actual content vs HTML size
   - Returns True if JS rendering needed

3. **`fetch_html_with_js(url, timeout, user_agent)`** - Playwright fetcher
   - Launches headless Chromium
   - Uses smart wait strategies:
     - `domcontentloaded` (faster than `networkidle`)
     - Dynamic wait for content to appear
     - Fallback to fixed timeouts
   - Scrolls page to trigger lazy loading
   - Returns fully rendered HTML

4. **`use_js_rendering`** parameter - User control
   - Default: `True` (auto-detect and render)
   - Can be disabled for pure static crawling

### Integration in Crawl Flow

```python
# Try static HTML first (fast)
html = await fetch_html(client, url, timeout)

# Check if JS rendering is needed
if html and use_js_rendering and is_js_rendered_site(html):
    # Retry with Playwright
    html_js = await fetch_html_with_js(url, timeout, user_agent)
    if html_js:
        html = html_js

# Continue with normal extraction...
```

## 📦 Dependencies Added

```txt
playwright==1.49.0
```

### Installation

```bash
# Install Python package
pip install playwright==1.49.0

# Install Chromium browser (one-time)
python -m playwright install chromium
```

**Docker**: Add to Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
RUN pip install playwright==1.49.0
RUN python -m playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

---

## 🎯 Usage

### Automatic (Recommended)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/crawl \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://www.eratos.ch",
    "depth": 1,
    "max_pages": 10,
    "use_js_rendering": true
  }'
```

The crawler will:
1. Try static HTML first (fast)
2. Detect if it's a SPA
3. Automatically use Playwright if needed
4. Extract content and links
5. Follow links and repeat

### Manual Control

```python
# Force JS rendering off (static sites only, faster)
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "use_js_rendering": false
}

# Force JS rendering on (all sites use Playwright, slower but thorough)
{
  "url": "https://spa-site.com",
  "use_js_rendering": true
}
```

## ⚡ Performance

### Traditional Sites (80% of web)
- **Method**: httpx only
- **Speed**: 50-200ms per page
- **No change** from before

### SPA Sites (20% of web)
- **Detection**: +5-10ms (HTML analysis)
- **Rendering**: +2-5 seconds per page (browser launch, JS execution)
- **Trade-off**: Slower but gets actual content

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Browser Reuse** (Future): Keep browser alive between pages (10x faster)
2. **Smart Detection**: Only render when absolutely needed
3. **Parallel Crawling**: Multiple browser contexts
4. **Timeout Tuning**: Adjustable wait times

## 🧪 Test Results

### Test Site: eratos.ch (React SPA)

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "url": "https://www.eratos.ch/",
  "depth": 1,
  "max_pages": 5,
  "timeout": 20.0,
  "use_js_rendering": true
}
```

**Results**:
```
✅ Pages crawled: 5
✅ Average content: 2,000+ chars/page
✅ Links found: 10+
✅ Total output: 8,915 chars
✅ Contacts extracted: email, address
✅ Content quality: High
```

**Pages Found**:
1. Homepage - Company info, benefits
2. /feasibility-studies - Service details
3. /about - Team & mission
4. /pricing - Plans
5. /contact - Contact form

## 🔍 Detection Examples

### Detected as JS-Rendered ✅

**React** (eratos.ch):
```html
<div id="root"></div>
<script src="bundle.js"></script>
```

**Next.js**:
```html
<div id="__next"></div>
```

**Vue.js**:
```html
<div id="app" data-v-app></div>
```

**Angular**:
```html
<app-root ng-app></app-root>
```

### Detected as Static ✅

**WordPress**, **Django**, **Rails**:
```html
<body>
  <header>...</header>
  <main>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Lots of content...</p>
  </main>
</body>
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Playwright not available"
**Solution**: 
```bash
pip install playwright==1.49.0
python -m playwright install chromium
```

### Issue: Timeouts on slow sites
**Solution**: Increase timeout
```json
{
  "timeout": 30.0
}
```

### Issue: Missing content on SPA
**Solution**: The crawler already:
- Waits for DOM content
- Waits for body content
- Scrolls to trigger lazy loading
- Waits extra 1-3 seconds

If still missing, check browser console for errors.

### Issue: Too slow
**Solution**: 
1. Disable JS rendering for static sites:
   ```json
   {"use_js_rendering": false}
   ```
2. Reduce max_pages
3. Use depth=0 for single page
